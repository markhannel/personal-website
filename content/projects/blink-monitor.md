## ðŸ“Œ TL;DR 

I wanted to stop guessing when my local gym would be packed, so I built a personal dashboard to tell me.

## ðŸ’¾ The Full Story

Blinks app and website offer limited information on how many people are in the gym.
 
## ðŸ¥ƒ Distilled Story

- Deployed a script to scrape real-time gym occupancy data from Blink's exposed API
- Stored the data in a time-series database (InfluxDB) for efficient querying and retention
- Visualized occupancy trends using a Grafana dashboard for monitoring and analysis
