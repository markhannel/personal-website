# Hi, I'm Mark.

I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Impact Observatory where I leverage machine learning to create global maps from satellite imagery and remote sensing data. Our team developed the first global, 10 meter land use and land cover map, and have since made a series of these maps extending from 2017 through 2022. Check our work out at https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcoverexplorer

I get excited about opportunities where I leverage my background in physics, mathematics, and computer vision to tackle hard technical challenges with immediate impact.
